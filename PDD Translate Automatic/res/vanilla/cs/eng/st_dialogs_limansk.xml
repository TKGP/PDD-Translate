		<text>Thanks for saving my ass. Looks like you're going to town. Watch out - Red's people set up an ambush on the street ahead. They tied a wire next to a car - don't trip over it. Keep to the right side of the street and you'll pass unharmed.</text>

		<text>A whole bunch of people making a hell of a mess. Duty and Freedom both marched to the center of town - must be looking for a path to the center of the Zone. We saw a few choppers, so the military is visiting too. Some stalkers are also in town, but they are coming from the other side, from the center of the Zone.</text>

		<text>Our boss and his men dug in in a house a little ways down the street. They won't go any further. If you want to get into town, you'll have to smoke them out of that house.</text>
